# Dairy Django Backend

## Overview

Welcome to the Dairy Django Backend repository! This project aims to develop a robust backend system for managing a dairy farm. The initial focus will be on implementing user authentication and role-based access control to ensure secure and efficient farm management.

## Features

### 1. User Authentication

Implementing a secure user authentication system to manage access to the farm's backend. Users will be able to create accounts, log in securely, and maintain the confidentiality of their data.

### 2. Role-Based Access Control

Introducing role-based access control to assign specific roles to users based on their responsibilities in the farm. This ensures that different team members have appropriate access levels, enhancing security and streamlining operations.
